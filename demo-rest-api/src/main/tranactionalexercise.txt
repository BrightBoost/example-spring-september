- Make the service methods in your endpoints transactional
- Test every method and the rollback capabilities and see if you need to make changes to it
- Throw a runtime exception in the update method when the name is shorter than 2 characters
- Throw a checked exception in the put method if the age is not set, specify that you donâ€™t need to rollback for this exception
- Bonus: what happens to your many to many objects? Are they rolled back as well?
- Bonus: how does Spring implement transactional methods under the hood?
